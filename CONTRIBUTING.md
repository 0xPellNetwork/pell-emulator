# Contributing to Pell Emulator

### Code of Conduct

Have you read the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/0xPellNetwork/pell-emulator/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)?

## Bugs and Feature Requests

Before making changes, check to see if an [issue](https://github.com/0xPellNetwork/pell-emulator/issues) already exists for the change you want to make.

### Don't See Your Issue? Open One

If you don't find an existing issue, open a new one using the [issue template](https://github.com/0xPellNetwork/pell-emulator/issues/new/choose). Use the issue to discuss the problem you'd like to address.

### Opening a Pull Request

Before submitting a pull request, fork the repository and create a new branch.

Once you're ready to propose your changes, open a pull request using the pull request template.

If your pull request is still a work in progress and not ready for review, mark it as a draft and add the label `wip` (work in progress). This label helps us filter out incomplete PRs.

### Adding New Features or Changing Existing Ones

To suggest a new feature or change an existing one, start by opening an issue and discussing the change with the team.

### Improving Issues and PRs

Please assign reviewers, assignees, and labels to your issues and PRs, if possible.

## DOs and DON'Ts

Please **do**:

* **DO** adhere to the current style of the project or file you're changing, even if it diverges from the general guidelines.
* **DO** include tests when adding new features. When fixing bugs, add a test that demonstrates how the current behavior is broken.
* **DO** follow the rules in the [Contributing section](https://github.com/0xPellNetwork/pell-emulator/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md#contributing) of our code of conduct.
* **DO** write idiomatic Go code.

Please **do not**:

* **DON'T** leave issue and PR descriptions vague. The templates are there for a reasonâ€”please fill them out fully to help the team.
* **DON'T** submit large pull requests without prior discussion. Instead, open an issue to start a conversation, so we can agree on the direction before you invest significant time.
